This experiment is part of an ongoing project by Chris Zheng and Daniel Slutsky
during Feb 2025.

We explore our workflow with Emacs, CIDER, Clojure, Echarts, gptel, and various
AI chats in a data analysis problem.

The code was generated in a conversation with AI models.
Sometimes, we helped them by earsing wrong code, correcting (rare) mistakes,
modifying the questions, and editing the text to include printed data
that would help them.

This is work-in-progress. There is more to explore.

## Using `claude-3-sonnet-20241022`


### What is it about?

This appears to be bike-sharing trip data from Divvy (Chicago's bike-share system) for April 2023. Each row represents a single trip with details including:

- Ride ID
- Bike type (showing electric bikes in these examples)
- Start and end times
- Start/end coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- User type (showing "member" in these examples)

The empty fields between commas indicate missing station name/ID data for these particular rides.



### Can you please suggest some code to parse the data? Please use the file path we used above.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(defn load-trips []
  (with-open [reader (io/reader "data/202304_divvy_tripdata.csv")]
    (->> (csv/read-csv reader)
         (map zipmap (repeat [:ride-id :bike-type :started-at :ended-at 
                              :start-station :start-station-id :end-station :end-station-id
                              :start-lat :start-lng :end-lat :end-lng :member-type]))
         rest  ; skip header
         (into []))))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def trips (load-trips))
```

### Please provide code to look into a few values inside the data.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure

Look at first 3 trips









































Or more specifically:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(->> trips
     (take 5)
     (map #(select-keys % [:bike-type :member-type])))
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:bike-type "electric_bike", :member-type "member"}
 {:bike-type "electric_bike", :member-type "member"}
 {:bike-type "electric_bike", :member-type "member"}
 {:bike-type "electric_bike", :member-type "member"}
 {:bike-type "electric_bike", :member-type "member"})

```
:::


Look at bike and member types








### Do you find anything interesting in the printed data?



Yes - these first few entries show a pattern:
1. All rides are on electric bikes
2. All riders are members
3. All station data (names/IDs) are empty strings
4. All coordinates are in Chicago area (around 41°N, 87°W)

Let's check if this pattern holds for the whole dataset or if there's more variety.



### Great. Can you suggest some checks you would do over the whole dataset?

Check unique bike types


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(->> trips
     (map :bike-type)
     distinct)
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
("electric_bike" "classic_bike" "docked_bike")

```
:::


Check unique member types


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(->> trips
     (map :member-type)
     distinct)
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
("member" "casual")

```
:::


Count empty vs non-empty station names


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(->> trips
     (group-by #(empty? (:start-station %)))
     (map (fn [[k v]] [k (count v)])))
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
([true 63814] [false 362776])

```
:::



### What have you learned from the new checks?



From these checks we learned:

1. There are 3 bike types (electric, classic, docked)
2. There are 2 rider types (member, casual)
3. Most trips (362,776) have station data, while some (63,814) don't
4. This is quite different from our initial sample which showed only electric bikes and members




### Please suggest some code for data visualization using Kindly and Echarts.
You should use an Apache Echarts spec and wrap your plot with `(kind/echarts ...)`.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def bike-type-counts
  (->> trips
       (group-by :bike-type)
       (map (fn [[k v]] {:name k :value (count v)}))))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
bike-type-counts
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:name "electric_bike", :value 247965}
 {:name "classic_bike", :value 169738}
 {:name "docked_bike", :value 8887})

```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(kind/echarts
 {:xAxis {:type "category"}
  :yAxis {:type "value"}
  :series [{:type "pie"
            :data bike-type-counts
            :radius "50%"}]
  :title {:text "Bike Types Distribution"}})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div style="height:400px;width:100%;"><script>
{
  var myChart = echarts.init(document.currentScript.parentElement);
  myChart.setOption({"xAxis":{"type":"category"},"yAxis":{"type":"value"},"series":[{"type":"pie","data":[{"name":"electric_bike","value":247965},{"name":"classic_bike","value":169738},{"name":"docked_bike","value":8887}],"radius":"50%"}],"title":{"text":"Bike Types Distribution"}});
};</script></div>
```



## Continuing with `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`


### Please now explain your insights so far like I'm 5YO.


Imagine there's a big bike-sharing program in Chicago, like a library but for bikes! Let me tell you what we found:

1. They have three types of bikes:
- Electric bikes (like bikes with a helper motor)
- Regular bikes (what we call "classic")
- Docked bikes (special bikes that need to go back to their home)

2. There are two kinds of people who use the bikes:
- Members (like having a library card)
- Casual riders (like borrowing a book just once)

3. The electric bikes are the most popular - almost half of all rides!

4. Most bikes get picked up and dropped off at special bike stations, but sometimes people can leave them in other places too.

It's like having a huge toy box of bikes that everyone in Chicago can share! 🚲


### I like it! From now on, please give me explanations like you just gave. And use many mode emojis. ✨



Will do! I'll keep things simple and fun with lots of emojis! 🚲 ✨ 🌟 

Let's make data more like telling stories about bikes and their adventures! 🎯

Would you like to explore something specific about our bike friends? 🤔



### I would love to see some more cooooool data visualizations using Echarts. Please be creative.


Let's make a fun visualization showing rides by member type! 🎨


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def member-counts
  (->> trips
       (group-by :member-type)
       (map (fn [[k v]] {:name k :value (count v)}))))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
member-counts
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:name "member", :value 279305} {:name "casual", :value 147285})

```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(kind/echarts
 {:series [{:type "pie"
            :data member-counts
            :radius ["40%" "70%"]  ;; Makes it a donut! 🍩
            :itemStyle {:borderRadius 10}  ;; Rounded corners! ✨
            :label {:show true
                    :formatter "{b}: {c} rides"}}]
  :title {:text "Who Rides Our Bikes? 🚲"
          :left "center"}})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div style="height:400px;width:100%;"><script>
{
  var myChart = echarts.init(document.currentScript.parentElement);
  myChart.setOption({"series":[{"type":"pie","data":[{"name":"member","value":279305},{"name":"casual","value":147285}],"radius":["40%","70%"],"itemStyle":{"borderRadius":10},"label":{"show":true,"formatter":"{b}: {c} rides"}}],"title":{"text":"Who Rides Our Bikes? \ud83d\udeb2","left":"center"}});
};</script></div>
```


This is like a fancy donut chart showing members vs casual riders! 🍩


### Please explain the above plot. How do I read it? What can I learn from it?

Let me explain this fun donut chart! 🍩

Think of it like splitting a donut into two parts: 
- The bigger piece (279,305 rides) is from our regular members 🎫
- The smaller piece (147,285 rides) is from casual riders 🎟️

What does this tell us? 🤔
- About 2 out of every 3 rides are by members
- Members are like our "regular customers" who use bikes often
- Casual riders (like tourists or occasional users) make up the rest

It's like having a pizza party 🍕 where:
- Your best friends (members) eat more slices
- Party guests (casual riders) eat fewer slices

This helps the bike company know:
- Most people really like their service enough to become members! 🌟
- There's still lots of people trying out bikes for fun! ✨


### Thank you so much. Please propose a few time-related plots.

I'll help create some fun time-based plots! First, let's prepare the data by parsing dates properly 🕒


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(defn parse-datetime [s]
  (-> s
      (.replace " " "T")  ; Convert to ISO format
      java.time.LocalDateTime/parse))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def trips-with-times
  (->> trips
       (map #(update % :started-at parse-datetime))
       (map #(update % :ended-at parse-datetime))))
```
:::


Let's start with rides by hour of day! 🌅


### Please provide code to look into a few values of `trip-with-times`.

Let's peek at our time-parsed data 🕒

Look at first 2 entries


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(take 2 trips-with-times)
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:start-station-id "",
  :start-station "",

Or more specifically, just the timestamps:

     (take 3)
     (map #(select-keys % [:started-at :ended-at])))
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure

  #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x4f888f1a "2023-04-02T08:37:28"],
  :ended-at
  #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x728cb6d4 "2023-04-02T08:41:37"]}
 {:started-at
  #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x1d909336 "2023-04-19T11:29:02"],
  :ended-at

 {:started-at
  #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x6a2fb3d0 "2023-04-19T08:41:22"],
  :ended-at
  #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x87cd47d "2023-04-19T08:43:22"]})

```

This will help us confirm our date parsing worked correctly! ✨

- Each bar shows how many people rode bikes during that hour
- We can see two big "peaks" 🏔️:
- One in the morning (around 8AM) - People going to work/school! 🎒
- One in the afternoon (around 5PM) - People heading home! 🏠
- The middle of the night (like 3AM) is very quiet 😴
- Weekends might look different, but they're mixed in here

Would you like to see another type of time plot? Maybe by day of week? 🗓️


### Thanks! What can we learn from the numbers we just saw?


Let me break down the interesting patterns in those numbers! 🔍

The busiest times are:
- 5 PM (hour 17): 46,889 rides 🏆
- 4 PM (hour 16): 40,374 rides 🥈
- 6 PM (hour 18): 38,281 rides 🥉

The quietest times are:
- 4 AM: only 950 rides 😴
- 3 AM: 1,165 rides 🌙
- 2 AM: 1,874 rides 🌠

Fun facts:
- More than 40x more people ride at 5 PM than at 4 AM! 🤯
- Rush hour (4-6 PM) accounts for about 125,544 rides 🚲
- Early morning commute (7-9 AM) has about 56,551 rides 🌅

This tells us:
1. People love using bikes to get home from work! 🏢
2. Late night/early morning riders are brave souls! 🦸
3. Afternoon rides are more popular than morning rides 📊

It's like watching a city wake up, buzz with activity, and then slowly go to sleep! 🌆



### Fantastic. Can you provide a plot about how long people ride the bike?



Here's a code to analyze ride durations! ⏱️

Calculate ride durations in minutes


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def ride-durations
  (->> trips-with-times
       (map #(let [start (:started-at %)
                   end (:ended-at %)
                   duration (.until start end java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit/MINUTES)]
               duration))
       (filter #(and (>= % 0) (<= % 120)))))
```
:::


Filter reasonable durations (0-120 min)


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(take 10 ride-durations)
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
(4 23 2 3 4 4 9 4 10 0)

```
:::


Create duration distribution plot


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(kind/echarts
 {:xAxis {:type "category"
          :data (range 0 121 10)
          :name "Ride Duration (minutes)"}
  :yAxis {:type "value"
          :name "Number of Rides"}
  :series [{:type "bar"
            :data (->> ride-durations
                       (map #(quot % 10))  ;; Group by 10-minute intervals
                       frequencies
                       (sort-by key)
                       (map second))
            :itemStyle {:color "#5470c6"}
            :emphasis {:itemStyle {:color "#3c50a0"}}}]
  :title {:text "How Long Do People Ride? ⏱️"
          :left "center"}})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div style="height:400px;width:100%;"><script>
{
  var myChart = echarts.init(document.currentScript.parentElement);
  myChart.setOption({"xAxis":{"type":"category","data":[0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120],"name":"Ride Duration (minutes)"},"yAxis":{"type":"value","name":"Number of Rides"},"series":[{"type":"bar","data":[235795,112350,39353,16661,8067,4130,2667,1699,1233,836,654,482,36],"itemStyle":{"color":"#5470c6"},"emphasis":{"itemStyle":{"color":"#3c50a0"}}}],"title":{"text":"How Long Do People Ride? \u23f1\ufe0f","left":"center"}});
};</script></div>
```



### Please compute some binned statistics of ride durations, so you can describe them in words. Use 10-minute bins.


Let's create some fun statistics about ride times! ⏱️

Create 10-minute bins and count rides


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def duration-bins
  (->> ride-durations
       (map #(quot % 10))  ;; Group by 10-minute intervals
       frequencies
       (sort-by key)
       (map (fn [[bin count]] 
              {:minutes (str (* bin 10) "-" (* (inc bin) 10))
               :count count}))))
```
:::


Show the counts


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
duration-bins
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:minutes "0-10", :count 235795}
 {:minutes "10-20", :count 112350}
 {:minutes "20-30", :count 39353}
 {:minutes "30-40", :count 16661}
 {:minutes "40-50", :count 8067}
 {:minutes "50-60", :count 4130}
 {:minutes "60-70", :count 2667}
 {:minutes "70-80", :count 1699}

 {:minutes "100-110", :count 654}
 {:minutes "110-120", :count 482}
 {:minutes "120-130", :count 36})

```

### What do we see in the numbers? Please summarize to me, I am overwhelmed.


Let me break this down into a fun, simple story! 🚲

Most people are quick riders! 
- About 235,795 rides (the biggest group) are super quick (0-10 minutes) ⚡
- Another 112,350 rides take 10-20 minutes 🚴
- Only about 39,353 rides take 20-30 minutes 🌟

Think of it like this:
1. Quick trips (0-10 min) are like riding to the corner store 🏪
2. Medium trips (10-20 min) are like riding to a friend's house 🏠
3. Longer trips (20+ min) are like scenic rides in the park 🌳

Fun fact: Very few people (only 482!) ride for 2 whole hours! That's like watching a movie on a bike! 🎬

The big picture: Most people use these bikes for quick trips around the city, not for long adventures! 🌆


## Continuing with `gpt-4o`


### Can you please suggest a couple of additional cool plots that will help me understand the data? Be creative.

Sure! Let's create a couple more fun plots to explore our bike-sharing data! 🎉


### 1. Ride Duration by Bike Type 🚲
We can visualize how ride durations vary across different bike types. This will help us see if certain bikes are used for shorter or longer trips.

Calculate average duration per bike type


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def durations-by-bike
  (->> (map #(assoc % :duration 
                    (let [start (:started-at %)
                          end (:ended-at %)]
                      (.until start end java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit/MINUTES)))
            trips-with-times)
       (group-by :bike-type)
       (map (fn [[k v]] {:bike-type k 
                         :avg-duration (/ (reduce + (map :duration v)) (count v))}))))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
durations-by-bike
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:bike-type "electric_bike", :avg-duration 2797243/247965}
 {:bike-type "classic_bike", :avg-duration 3064309/169738}
 {:bike-type "docked_bike", :avg-duration 1272793/8887})

```
:::

};</script></div>
```



### Explanation
- This chart shows the average ride duration for each type of bike.
- You might notice that classic bikes have a slightly longer average duration compared to electric bikes, which can indicate differences in usage patterns! 🌍



### 2. Rides by Day of Week 📅
Let’s see how many rides happen on each day of the week. This is important to understand biking patterns over time!

Count rides by day of the week


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(def rides-by-day
  (->> trips-with-times
       (map #(.getDayOfWeek (:started-at %)))
       (frequencies)
       (map (fn [[day count]] 
              {:day day :count count}))))
```
:::



::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
rides-by-day
```
:::



::: {.printedClojure}
```clojure
({:day #object[java.time.DayOfWeek 0x60986504 "SUNDAY"], :count 48314}

};</script></div>
```



### Explanation
- This line graph shows how many rides happen each day of the week.
- You can see that weekdays are generally busier, with Friday and Thursday being particularly popular! 🎉

These additional plots should give you more insights into our bike-sharing adventures! 🚲✨ Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area? 🚀



### Can you summarize this whole report for me? Just please offere me a clear bottom line.



Absolutely! Here’s the bottom line of our exploration into the bike-sharing data:  

1. **Bike Types**: The fleet includes electric bikes, classic bikes, and docked bikes, with electric bikes being the most popular. 🌟  
2. **User Types**: Most rides are by members, indicating strong usage loyalty, while casual riders make up a smaller portion. 🎟️  
3. **Time of Day**: Rides peak during work commute hours, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. 🌆  
4. **Ride Duration**: Most rides are quick, averaging under 20 minutes, suggesting users primarily take short trips. ⚡  
5. **Weekly Trends**: Weekdays generally see more rides than weekends, with particularly high activity on Thursdays and Fridays. 📈  

This data illustrates a strong and active bike-sharing community that favors short, convenient trips primarily during weekdays! 🚲✨





### Now, can you please add a couple of really pretty plots? Be creative, use nice aesthetics.



Sure! Let's add some visually engaging plots to enhance our insights! 🎨✨


### 1. Ride Duration by Member Type 🍕
We'll create a vibrant bar chart showing average ride durations for members vs. casual riders. This will highlight how each group uses the bike-sharing service differently!
